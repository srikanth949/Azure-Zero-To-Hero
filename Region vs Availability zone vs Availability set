Imagine a city (Region):

Each neighborhood (Availability Zone) has separate power & water.

Each apartment building (Availability Set) has multiple backup generators (Fault Domains).

So even if one building loses power (FD fails), others stay running.
If one neighborhood floods (Zone outage), others in the city are fine.
If the whole city faces a disaster, the nearby city (Paired Region) takes over.
